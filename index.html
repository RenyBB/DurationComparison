// Task description
/* Participants will hear pairs of sounds and have to say which sound (1st or 2nd) is higher in pitch.
   The task consists of training phase (2 trials) and test phase (30 trials).
   In the training phase participants receive feedback whether their response was correct or incorrect.
   There is no feedback in the test phase. On some trials in the test phase participants are also asked an additional subjective rating question. 
   There are 4 different subejctive question. Each is repeated twice.
